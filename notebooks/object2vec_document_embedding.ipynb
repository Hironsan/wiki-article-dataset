    "In this notebook, we introduce four new features to Object2Vec, a general-purpose neural embedding algorithm: negative sampling, sparse gradient update, weight-sharing, and comparator operator customization. The new features together broaden the applicability of Object2Vec, improve its training speed and accuracy, and provide users with greater flexibility. See [Introduction to the Amazon SageMaker Object2Vec](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introduction-to-amazon-sagemaker-object2vec/) if you aren’t already familiar with Object2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how these new features extend the applicability of Object2Vec to a new Document Embedding use-case: A customer has a large collection of documents. Instead of storing these documents in its raw format or as sparse bag-of-words vectors, to achieve training efficiency in the various downstream tasks, she would like to instead embed all documents in a common low-dimensional space, so that the semantic distance between these documents are preserved."

    "- The learned embeddings can be used to efficiently compute nearest neighbors of objects, as well as to visualize natural clusters of related objects in the embedding space. In addition, the embeddings can also be used as features of the corresponding objects in downstream supervised tasks such as classification or regression."

    "We demonstrate how, with the new features, Object2Vec can be used to embed a large collection of documents into vectors in the same latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the widely used Word2Vec algorithm for word embedding, a natural approach to document embedding is to preprocess documents as (sentence, context) pairs, where the sentence and its matching context come from the same document. The matching context is the entire document with the given sentence removed. The idea is to embed both sentence and context into a low dimensional space such that their mutual similarity is maximized, since they belong to the same document and therefore should be semantically related. The learned encoder for the context can then be used to encode new documents into the same embedding space. In order to train the encoders for sentences and documents, we also need negative (sentence, context) pairs so that the model can learn to discriminate between semantically similar and dissimilar pairs. It is easy to generate such negatives by pairing sentences with documents that they do not belong to. Since there are many more negative pairs than positives in naturally occurring data, we typically resort to random sampling techniques to achieve a balance between positive and negative pairs in the training data. The figure below shows pictorially how the positive pairs and negative pairs are generated from unlabeled data for the purpose of learning embeddings for documents (and sentences)."
